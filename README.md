# Emby application on Samsung SmartTV Series D

## Installation via an IP address

Put the **widgetlist.xml** file and the **Widget** folder at the root of your web directory and configure your web server so that your "localhost" or "local IP" address directly reaches your web directory.

## Installation via USB

I created a **MediaBrowser 3** folder in the root of the USB drive. Then unzipped **Emby_1.0.6_Europe_20160120.zip** file into this folder.
